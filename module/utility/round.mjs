// Rounding rules for cost calculations. We do not limit rounding to 1 because something
// may or may not be used for a cost calculation. That minimum cost is handled elsewhere.
//
// Whenever something in the rules requires multiplication or
// division, handle round-offs as follows: results ending in .1 to .4
// round to the next integer number towards 0, results ending in .6 to
// .9 round to the next integer number away from 0, and results ending in .5
// round towards or away, whichever is to the advantage of the Player Character.
//
// NOTE: The Hero System assumes that all numbers being rounded are positive but we don't
//       always deal with positive numbers (e.g. range penalties) so we do not use only
//       whole numbers and rounding up or down as described in the books - we are more general.
//
// See FRed. pg 7 and 6e Vol 1 pg 12. Both require rounding to 1 decimal digit.
// NOTE: Fraction rounding for advantages/limitations does not follow these rules.
